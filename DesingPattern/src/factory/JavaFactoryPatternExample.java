/*
One benefit of Factory Method design pattern is that it decouples 
the calling class from the target class, resulting in less coupling
and highly unified code. JDBC is really a perfect example of this design
pattern; software program does not have to understand which database to choose,
so now it really does nâ€™t know which database-specific driver classes to choose.
It utilises factory methods instead to connect with the database..
